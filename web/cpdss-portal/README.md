This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="450"></p>

üîé **Nx is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.**
This Workspace consist of two projects one Login App and CPDSS main application.
Run `npm install` command for intalling all dependencies and devDependencies.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/nx-community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@cpdss-portal/mylib`.

## Development server

Run following commands for a dev server. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. We will be maintaining seperate configurations for ship and shore side applications.

`npm run start:login:ship` // Login app will be available on port 9001
`npm run start:login:shore` // Login app will be available on port 9002
`npm run start:cpdss:ship` // CPDSS main app will available on port 9003
`npm run start:cpdss:shore` // CPDSS main app will available on port 9004

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Test Build

Run following commands to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

`npm run build:login:ship:test`
`npm run build:loginshore:tets`
`npm run build:cpdss:ship:test`
`npm run build:cpdss:shore:tets`

## Production Build

Run following commands to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

`npm run build:login:ship`
`npm run build:login:shore`
`npm run build:cpdss:ship`
`npm run build:cpdss:shore`

## Running unit tests

Run following commands to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

`npm run test:cpdss`
`npm run test:login`
`npm run test:cpdss:watch`
`npm run test:login:watch`
`npm run test:cpdss:coverage`
`npm run test:login:coverage`

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
