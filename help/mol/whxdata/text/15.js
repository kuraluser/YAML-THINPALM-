The trim can significantly impact a vessel's energy demand for propulsion during sailing."," ","Bending Moment"," ","The bending moment is the amount of bending caused to the ship's hull by the external forces."," ","Shearing Force"," ","When two external parallel forces act in opposite directions on any part of a structure to break it apart or shear it, they are known as shearing forces and measured in tonnes. Shearing stress is, therefore, the stress that may break or shear the structure apart."," ","Bunker"," ","Bunkers include all dutiable petroleum products loaded aboard a vessel for consumption by that vessel."," ","Ullage"," ","Ullage is a measurement of space between the liquid surface in a tank and the top of the tank's inner surface. "," ","Sounding"," ","Sounding is a term used to measure the quantity of fluids in the tanks of a ship. "," ","Loadline"," ","The load line is a marking indicating the extent to which the weight of a load may safely submerge a ship through a waterline limit."," ","Correction Factor"," ","The Correction Factor is a standardized computed factor used to correct the thermal expansion of fluids."," ","Draft Restriction"," ","The Draft Restriction is the height from the seabed to the waterline."," ","Stowage Plan"," ","The Stowage plan for container ships or bay plan is the plan and method by which different types of container vessels are loaded with containers of specific standard sizes. The plans are used to maximize the economy of shipping and safety on board."," ","Manifold"," ","The manifold is a complex metal casting, actually a pipe within a pipe. It collects the extremely hot exhaust gases directly from the engine into an inner \"pipe\" or long chamber which is usually cooled by raw water running through an outer casing."," ","Slop Tanks"," ","The Slop tanks are specifically designated for the collection of tank draining, tank washing and other oily mixture."," ","Hogging and Sagging"," ","Hogging is the stress a ship's hull or keel experiences that cause the center or the keel to bend upward. Sagging is the stress a ship's hull or keel experiences when a wave is the same length as the ship, and the ship is in the trough of two waves."," ","Gantt Chart"," ","A chart in which a series of horizontal lines shows the amount of work done or production completed in specific periods of time concerning the amount planned for those periods."," ","Highchart"," ","Highcharts is a pure JavaScript-based charting library that enhances web applications by adding interactive charting capability. Highcharts provides a wide variety of charts. For example, line charts, spline charts, area charts, bar charts, pie charts and so on."]],"id":"15"})
